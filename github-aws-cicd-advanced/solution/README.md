# Workshop Solution

- This folder contains a completed version of the tasks to accomplish during the workshop as such, some files have been suffixed with `-done`. There is also a stack file, `Pulumi.done.yaml` added. The `done` stack is used to deploy a completed version **before** the workshop as a backup.
- This is a GitHub repo and should, therefore, be its own. It needs the `PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN` configured.
