# Advanced CI/CD with GitHub Actions and Pulumi for AWS

Last revision: August 2024.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is an advanced workshop that builds upon the concepts of the [Getting Started workshop](../github-aws-cicd-getting-started/). It is highly recommended that workshop is completled before proceeding.

In this workshop, you will learn advanced topics that make up a robust infrastructure CI/CD pipeline through guided exercises. You will use Pulumi tooling to take your cloud infrastructure pipeline one step closer to production.

This workshop introduces users to advanced best practices. You will add compliance checks via policies, drift detection, and isolated test environments to an existing GitHub Actions pipeline. This will help accelerate your AWS projects with the code examples provided.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learn how to

- Add AWS OIDC credentials to your stack with Pulumi ESC.
- Add GitHub OIDC to auth with Pulumi Cloud thereby creating a secret-less pipeline.
- Add a policy check GitHub Action step to automatically check your infrastructure for compliance.
- Add a cron job GitHub Action workflow to check for drift.
- Configure a dedicated environment for your current branch with Pulumi Deployments.

</details>

## **Part I** Set up your Pulumi project with Pulumi ESC

This workshop picks up right where the [Getting Started](../github-aws-cicd-getting-started/) workshop left off, so we'll start with a sample application and a basic pipeline already in hand.

### **Part I** ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Attendees will be able to authenticate using Dynamic Credentials by adding a Pulumi ESC Environment with an AWS OIDC configuration.

<details>
<summary> Expand on the ðŸ“š concepts </summary>

**Dynamic Credentials**: Unlike static credentials, which remain constant over time, dynamic credentials are generated on the fly and have a short validity period, enhancing security by reducing the risk of unauthorized access from credential theft or misuse. It also eliminates the need for developers to manage the lifecycle of individual access keys for instances.

**OIDC**:  OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an authentication protocol built on top of the OAuth 2.0 framework. enables clients to authenticate users with a high degree of confidence while supporting single sign-on (SSO) and other identity-related functionalities.

**Pulumi ESC**: Pulumi ESC enables you to define Environments, which contain collections of secrets and configurations. Each Environment can be composed of multiple environments. An Environment may be used to store dynamic credentials from an OIDC IdP such as Pulumi Cloud to connect to your AWS.

</details>

### **Part I** ðŸŽ¬ Steps

<details>
<summary> âœ… [prep] Clone the Getting Started solution </summary>

```bash
# Clone the Getting Started repo
$ gh repo clone desteves/pulumi-workshop-cicd pulumi-workshop-cicd-advanced
```

</details>

<details>
<summary> âœ… Configure AWS Dynamic Credentials </summary>

- If your AWS Account already has an OIDC IDP for Pulumi Cloud, this will **not** work. Instead, update your existing audience for the AWS IAM Identity Provider and also add the name of your Pulumi Org to the Trust Relationship JSON for the corresponding AWS IAM Role.

```bash
# Ensure you're in ./infra
$ TEMPLATE_URL=https://github.com/pulumi/examples/tree/master/aws-ts-oidc-provider-pulumi-cloud

# Use a Pulumi template to create AWS OIDC Resources
$ pulumi new ${TEMPLATE_URL} --dir aws-oidc
# Go through the wizard and update the defaults as necessary

$ pulumi up --yes --cwd aws-oidc  --stack dev --continue-on-error
# wait for the resources to get created; this can take a couple of minutes

# Obtain the name of the ESC Environment
$ e=$(pulumi stack output escEnv --cwd aws-oidc)

# Add the ESC Environment to your Stack
# [live]
$ pulumi config env add ${e} --yes --non-interactive

# TODO -- test with
#  aws s3 ls

# Test the changes locally
$ pulumi preview
```

</details>

## **Part II** Add CIS compliance with Policy as Code

### **Part II** ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Attendees will be able to add compliance checks to the CI/CD pipeline using [Pulumi CrossGuard](https://www.pulumi.com/crossguard/?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=workshops).

<details>
<summary> Expand on the ðŸ“š concepts </summary>

**Cloud compliance**: refers to the process of ensuring that cloud-based systems, services, and data storage adhere to relevant laws, regulations, standards, and best practices governing security, privacy, and data protection.

**Policy as Code**: involves codifying policy definitions, which allows for their automated enforcement and evaluation within various stages of IT operations and development pipelines. This method leverages version control systems, automation tools, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to ensure that policies governing security, compliance, resource usage, and access controls are consistently applied across the entire ecosystem.

**Built-in packs**: bundle compliance policies that are easily extendable to speed up development and ensure best practices from day one.

</details>

### **Part II** ðŸŽ¬ Steps

By adding a default policy pack, your workflow will automatically ensure your stack is not violating any cloud infrastructure best practices.

<details>
<summary> âœ… [live] Add the CIS compliance framework to your Pulumi program </summary>

Center for Internet Security (CIS)

```bash
# From the `infra` directory

# Add the policy under the aws-cis/ folder
$ pulumi policy new aws-cis-compliance-policies-typescript  --dir aws-cis

# Add deps for GHA
# $ cd aws-cis
# # $ npm update --save
# # $ npm install @pulumi/policy @pulumi/compliance-policy-manager @pulumi/aws-compliance-policies
# $ pulumi up --yes
# $ cd ../

# Test locally
$ pulumi preview --policy-pack aws-cis --stack dev
# Policies:
#    âœ… aws-cis-compliance-ready-policies-typescript@v0.0.1 (local: aws-cis)

# Test programmatically
# Modify the workflow file
$ vi .github/workflows/branch.yml
#   edit the last step as shown below
#   save the file.
```

`branch.yml` code snippet:

```yaml
      - name: Install PaC Dependencies
        working-directory: ./infra/aws-cis
        run: npm install

      - name: Create the resources
        uses: pulumi/actions@v5
        with:
          command: up
          stack-name: pulumi-sandbox-diana/workshop/dev # !!! UPDATE THIS
          work-dir: ./infra
          policyPacks: aws-cis
        env:
          PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary> âœ… Commit the changes as a merged PR </summary>

```bash
# Commit your changes
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "add pac"

# Create a new feature branch
$ git checkout -b feature-pac

# Push the changes
$ git push --set-upstream origin feature-pac

# Create a PR

# !!! Update the PR merge number as needed
$ m=2
$ gh pr merge $m --squash
```

## **Part III** Add drift detection

### **Part III** ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Attendees will be able to programmatically identify when a drift has occurred in their infrastructure via an Actions cronjob.

<details>
<summary> Expand on the ðŸ“š concepts </summary>

**Drift** refers to the phenomenon where the actual state of your infrastructure diverges from the expected or declared state as defined in your code. This can occur for a variety of reasons, such as manual changes made directly to the infrastructure (outside of the IaC processes), external processes modifying the environment, or discrepancies in the execution of IaC scripts.

**Drift detection** refers to the process of identifying discrepancies between the actual state of your infrastructure and its expected state as defined by your IaC configurations. This process is crucial for maintaining consistency, reliability, and security in cloud environments, where infrastructure components are dynamically provisioned and managed through code.

**Reconciling the infrastructure** Once a drift is detected, the next step is to reconcile the infrastructure, which means resolving the differences between the actual state and the intended state. Reconciliation can be approached in different ways but two common approaches are to update the infrastructure to match the code or update the code to reflect the detected changes.

Both drift detection and infrastructure reconciliation are fundamental to the practice of infrastructure as code, allowing teams to maintain control over their environments and ensure that their infrastructure remains in a known, good state.

#   update `stack-name`
#   save the file.
```

<!-- TODO -- UPDATE -->

```yaml
name: drift
on:
  schedule:
    # Actions schedules runs every 5 minutes.
    - cron: '*/5 * * * *'
  workflow_dispatch: {}

jobs:
  main:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Drift Detection
    steps:
