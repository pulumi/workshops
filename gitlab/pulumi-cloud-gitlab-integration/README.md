# pulumi-gitlab-integration

The repo contains a codebase to demonstrate integration between Pulumi Cloud and GitLab. The code in this repo is based upon the following primary sources:

* <https://www.pulumi.com/docs/using-pulumi/continuous-delivery/gitlab-ci/>
* <https://www.pulumi.com/docs/using-pulumi/continuous-delivery/gitlab-app/>

## TODOs

* Does the build get triggered by the initial add of files?
* Can we confirm that changes to .gitlab-ci.yml lag behind by one commit?
* GitLab SSO for previews on the webhook

## Required Configuration

Set the name of the GitLab organization in which your repository will go:

```bash
pulumi config set gitlabOrg <your-gitlab-org-name>
```

## Optional Configuration

Set the Pulumi org in which the code in the repo generated by this repo will be deployed. Default to the same org as the resources in this repo. **NOTE:** The org containing the sample stack _must_ use GitLab as its identity provider or the GitLab webhook which shows preview results as Merge Request comments will not work.

```bash
pulumi config set pulumiOrg some-other-org
```

To use this codebase with a GitLab private installation (i.e. not gitlab.com):

```bash
pulumi config set gitlabAudience "gitlab.example.com"
```

**NOTE:** This codebase is not tested with private GitLab installs and will likely require debugging if not run against gitlab.com.

## Demo steps

1. Pre-requisites:
    1. Ensure your SSH key is set up in GitLab.
    1. Ensure your have a `GITLAB_TOKEN` set in your environment.
    1. Ensure you have a `PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN` set in your environment
    1. Ensure you have AWS credentials per the provider setup.
1. Deploy the AWS OIDC resources, GitLab repo, and files:

    ```bash
    cd pulumi-cloud-gitlab-integration
    pulumi up -y
    ```

1. Copy the git clone command:

    ```bash
    pulumi stack output gitCloneCommand | pbcopy
    ```

1. Clone the repo to a temporary directory:

    ```bash
    cd $(mktemp -d) && $(pbpaste)
    ```

1. Switch to a branch in the repo:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b my-branch
    ```

1. Add a Pulumi program to the repo, e.g.:

    ```bash
    pulumi new container-aws-typescript --force # The force option must be set because there are already files in the repo.
    ```

Optional:
