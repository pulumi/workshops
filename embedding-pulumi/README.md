# Embedding Pulumi

This Pulumi workshop aims to introduce you to the Pulumi Automation API to embed Pulumi in other systems.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following tools:

* [Pulumi CLI](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=workshops)
* [Pulumi FREE SaaS Account](https://app.pulumi.com/signup/?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=workshops)
  * Pulumi state storage is FREE for developers, you can use this account for all your personal Pulumi projects and you never need to worry about where to store your state ðŸ˜ƒ
* Python 3.9.x (Pulumi does not yet support Python 3.10)
* An AWS account. The free tier should be all we need, but any costs accrued will be minimal if any appear at all.
