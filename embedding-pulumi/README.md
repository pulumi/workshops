# Embedding Pulumi

This Pulumi workshop aims to introduce you to the Pulumi Automation API to embed Pulumi in other systems.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following tools:

* [Pulumi CLI]()
* [Pulumi FREE SaaS Account]()
  * Pulumi state storage is FREE for developers, you can use this account for all your personal Pulumi projects and you never need to worry about where to store your state 😃
* Python 3.9.x (Pulumi does not yet support Python 3.10)
* An AWS account. The free tier should be all we need, but any costs accrued will be minimal if any appear at all.

## About this workshop

In this workshop, we will explore how you could use Pulumi as an API for your infrastructure deployment and maintenance.

## Disclaimers

1. This workshop is currently in Python only, but that will change soon.
