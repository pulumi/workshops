  * If you don't have an account, go to the [signup page](https://app.pulumi.com/signup?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=workshops).
* The [Pulumi CLI](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=workshops)

### Azure Subscription and CLI

You'll also need an active Azure subscription to deploy the components of the application. You may use your developer subscription, or [create a free Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).

Please be sure to have administrative access to the subscription.

You will also use the Azure command-line interface (CLI) tool to log in to an Azure subscription. For detailed instructions, see [How to install the Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest).
