This is a **demo project** showcasing how Pulumi, C#, and Azure work together seamlessly.

## What This Demonstrates

- **🏗️ Pulumi Infrastructure as Code**: Complete Azure infrastructure defined in C#
- **⚡ Azure Functions**: Serverless .NET 8 isolated worker functions
- **☁️ Modern Deployment**: Zip-based deployment via blob storage and SAS URLs
- **🔄 End-to-End Automation**: Single command deploys both infrastructure and application code

## Key Technologies

- **Pulumi** with Azure Native provider
- **C# .NET 8** for both infrastructure and function code
- **Azure Functions** (Linux consumption plan)
- **Pure Infrastructure as Code** approach
