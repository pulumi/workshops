# Pulumi Workshops

This is the official repo for Pulumi workshops. If a workshop is running from Pulumi, you'll likely find the code and notes here.

> [!NOTE]
> To learn more about upcoming workshops, check out our [Events Page](https://www.pulumi.com/resources/)

## Audience

The primary audience for this repo's content is **workshop presenters**. Some workshops have matured enough to serve as self-guided material. However, other workshops may be outdated. We recommend focusing on workshops updated within the last year for the most relevant information.

## Content Structure

Each workshop has a directory containing:

1. A `README.md` file with workshop details and expectations
2. Subdirectories for different workshop labs

You don't need to clone this repo or its parts. Instead, use the provided code as guidance and copy relevant snippets into your solution.

> [!TIP]
> Many of the workshops listed in this repo have associated [On-Demand recordings](https://www.pulumi.com/resources/#on-demand) available.
