# Pulumi Workshops

This is the official repo for public Pulumi workshops. If a workshop is running from Pulumi, you'll likely find the code here!

Each workshop has a directory. Inside the directory is a README with details about the workshop and what to expect and subdirectories with different labs from the workshop. You generally are not expected to checkout a repo to do a workshop; code provided is for copying and pasting into your own workspace.
