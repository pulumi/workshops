# Pulumi Workshop: Getting Started with Infrastructure as Code on AWS

## Welcome, AWS Friends! 👋

The goal of this workshop is to learn the fundamentals of infrastructure as code using Pulumi through a series of
hands-on labs. You will learn how to create, deploy, and manage infrastructure on AWS using real programming languages.
We will start with the basics and then build on that foundation to create a fully functioning web application.

### Labs

We will cover the following topics in this workshop:

- [Create a Pulumi Project](workshop.md#create-a-pulumi-project)
- [Add AWS Resources to the Project](workshop.md#add-aws-resources-to-the-project)
- [Destroy the Project](workshop.md#destroy-the-project)

### Prerequisites

You will need to install these tools in order to complete this workshop:

- [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=workshops)
- [Pulumi Account](https://app.pulumi.com/signup?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=workshops) - this optional, but convenient to handle the state of the different
  stacks.
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)
- [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)

There is also a [devcontainer.json](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) file in this repository which you can use to spin
up a `devcontainer` with all the tools installed. Highly recommended if you are
using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview)
or [DevPods](https://devpod.sh).

### Cloud provider

This workshop uses [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) as cloud provider. If you don't have an account yet, you can create
one [here for free.](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)

### Troubleshooting Tips

1. You can reach out for me anytime! Happy to help you on track again.
2. Google the error! Honestly you will learn the most with this way.
