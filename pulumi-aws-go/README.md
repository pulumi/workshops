# Pulumi Workshop: Getting Started with Infrastructure as Code on AWS

## Welcome, AWS Friends! ðŸ‘‹

The goal of this workshop is to learn the fundamentals of infrastructure as code using Pulumi through a series of
hands-on labs. You will learn how to create, deploy, and manage infrastructure on AWS using real programming languages.
We will start with the basics and then build on that foundation to create a fully functioning web application.

### Labs

We will cover the following topics in this workshop:

- [Create a Pulumi Project](workshop.md#create-a-pulumi-project)
- [Add AWS Resources to the Project](workshop.md#add-aws-resources-to-the-project)
- [Destroy the Project](workshop.md#destroy-the-project)

### Prerequisites

You will need to install these tools in order to complete this workshop:

- [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/)
- [Pulumi Account](https://app.pulumi.com/signup) - this optional, but convenient to handle the state of the different
  stacks.
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)
- [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)

There is also a [devcontainer.json](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) file in this repository which you can use to spin
up a `devcontainer` with all the tools installed. Highly recommended if you are
using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview)
or [DevPods](https://devpod.sh).

### Cloud provider

This workshop uses [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) as cloud provider. If you don't have an account yet, you can create
one [here for free.](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)

### Troubleshooting Tips

If you get stuck during the workshops, you can try the following things in order:

1. You can reach out for me anytime! Happy to help you on track again.
2. Google the error! Honestly you will learn the most with this way.
3. Reach out the community in the Pulumi Community Slack. You can join the Slack [here](https://slack.pulumi.com/).
