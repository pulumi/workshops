# Advanced CI/CD for AWS using Pulumi and GitHub Actions

Last revision: February 2024.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is an advanced workshop that builds upon the [Getting Started workshop](../aws-getting-started-cicd/). Please make sure it's finished before proceeding.

In this workshop, you will learn advanced topics that make up a robust infrastructure CI/CD pipeline through guided exercises. You will use Pulumi tooling to take your cloud infrastructure pipeline one step closer to production.

This workshop introduces users to advanced DevOps best practices. You will add compliance checks via policies, drift detection, and isolated test environments to an existing GitHub Actions pipeline. This will help accelerate your AWS projects with the code examples provided.

## Learning Objectives

- Learn how to build an advanced CI pipeline to enforce compliance and correct drift.
- Add dynamic credentials to your stack by configuring Pulumi ESC.
- Add policy checks to test your infrastructure before each deployment.
- Add a cron job to the pipeline to check for changes periodically (drift)
- Configure a dedicated cloud environment with Review Stacks

## ðŸ§° Prerequisites

To go through this workshop with us, here is what you need:

### Pulumi

1. A Pulumi Cloud account, head to [app.pulumi.com](https://app.pulumi.com/signup/?utm_source=da&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=workshops&utm_content=ced-fall2022-workshops) and follow the sign-up process.
2. An [access token](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/pulumi-service/accounts/#access-tokens?utm_source=da&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=workshops&utm_content=ced-fall2022-workshops) from your Pulumi Cloud account.
3. The [Pulumi CLI]((https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/?utm_source=da&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=workshops&utm_content=ced-fall2022-workshops)) is installed in your development environment.

### GitHub

1. A [GitHub](https://github.com/join) account.
2. The [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/), [`gh`](https://cli.github.com/) is installed in your development environment.
3. [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) is installed in your development environment.

### AWS

1. The [`aws` CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) is installed in your development environment.
2. [Set up your local AWS credentials](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/aws/installation-configuration/#credentials).

## Part 1 - Set up your GitHub project with Pulumi ESC

This workshop picks up right where the [Getting Started](../aws-getting-started-cicd/) workshop left off, so we'll start with a sample application and a basic pipeline.

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Attendees will be able to authenticate using Dynamic Credentials by adding a Pulumi ESC Environment with an AWS OIDC configuration.

### ðŸ“š Concepts

*Dynamic Credentials* TODO

*Pulumi ESC* TODO

### ðŸŽ¬ Steps

âœ… Clone the Getting Started workshop solution

```bash
# Clone the repo
$ gh repo clone desteves/cicd-workshop

# Login to GitHub, if necessary
$ gh auth login

# Create your own repo
$ gh repo create cicd-workshop --public

# Nav to the cloned repo
$ cd cicd-workshop

#
# Update the owner value to your GitHub handle
$ owner=desteves 
$ repo=cicd-workshop

# Add your remote repo
$ git remote set-url origin "https://github.com/${owner}/${repo}.git"

# Push your clone
$ git push -u origin master
```

âœ… Add a secret to store your Pulumi access token to be used by Actions.

```bash
# Login to GitHub, if necessary
$ gh auth login

# Create the secret
$ gh secret set PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN -b pul-abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12
# âœ“ Set Actions secret PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN ...

# Verify it's there
$ gh secret list
# Press 'q' to exit
```

âœ… Modify the stack file to add a Pulumi ESC Environment

```bash

echo "environments" >> Pulumi.test.yaml
echo "  - cicd-workshop-env" >> Pulumi.test.yaml\


```

âœ… Add AWS OIDC Resources via the Pulumi Template

```bash
$ mkdir esc && cd esc
$ pulumi whoami
$ pulumi new aws-oidc // TODO build this
$ pulumi up --yes
$ cd ..
```

âœ… Create the Pulumi ESC Environment

```bash
$ pulumi esc env init diana-pulumi-corp/cicd-workshop-env



# --editor="code" 
$ pulumi esc env edit 
$ curl 
$
```


## Part 2 - Add compliance with Policy as Code

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Attendees will be able to add compliance checks to the CI/CD pipeline using Pulumi CrossGuad.

### ðŸ“š Concepts

*Policy as Code*

*Built-in packs*

### ðŸŽ¬ Steps

By adding a default policy pack, your workflow will automatically ensure your stack is not violating any cloud infrastructure best practices.

âœ… 
In your terminal, run

```bash
# Create a branch, 

# Add the policy.

# Modify the workflow file.

# Test locally 

# Commit the changes

# Merge the PR

```

## Part 3 - Add drift detection

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal

TODO

### ðŸ“š Concepts

*Drift detection* TODO 

*Reconciling the infrastructure* TODO

### ðŸŽ¬ Steps

In your terminal, run

```bash
#  Create a branch, 

#  Add the cron job workflow

# Commit & Merge PR

```

## Part 4 - Add dedicated environments with Review Stacks

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal

TODO

### ðŸ“š Concepts

*Test in isolation*

### ðŸŽ¬ Steps

In your terminal, run

```bash
#  Create a branch, 

#  Add the cron job workflow

# Commit & Merge PR

```

## Summary

You introduced advanced elements to your continuous infrastructure pipeline to make it more robust. In particular, you:
- Added a Pulumi ESC environment to retrieve dynamic credentials for AWS;
- Added policy checks to test your infrastructure for compliance;
- Added a drift detection cron job to the pipeline; and
- Configured dedicated cloud environments with Review Stacks.

## Next Steps

At this point, you have completed this workshop. You have 
- a GitHub repository with a sample application; 
- AWS resources using Pulumi IaC; and
- a robust cloud infrastructure CI/CD pipeline to test any change automatically. 

We encourage you to modify your app or infra and watch the changes be tested programmatically. Possible changes:

- Deploy your application in two regions
- Add a new AWS policy
