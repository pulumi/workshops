# Pulumi Packages in Go - Example in GCP

We're going to build a Pulumi Package, with a component built for Go for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). After that, we will demo consuming this component from a Pulumi YAML program.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following tools:

* [Pulumi CLI](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=workshops)
* [Pulumi FREE SaaS Account](https://app.pulumi.com/signup/?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=workshops)
  * Pulumi state storage is FREE for individuals, you can use this account for all your personal Pulumi projects and you never need to worry about where to store your state ðŸ˜ƒ
* [Go](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/languages/go/?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=workshops)
* A [GCP Account](https://cloud.google.com/) - the free trial should cover everything in this workshop but any costs accrued will be minimal

## Workshop contents

The workshop is divided into three labs:

### Lab 1 - Component schema

In this lab we will define our components in the Pulumi Schema file. [View lab 1](./lab1)

### Lab 2 - Component implementation

In the second lab we will take our schema from the first lab and implement our component in Go. [View lab 2](./lab2)

### Lab 3 - Component consumption

In the final lab we will use our component in a Pulumi YAML program. [View lab 3](./lab3)

## Get started

Let's get started with [lab 1](./lab1).
