# Introduction to Pulumi

This workshop introduces you to the basic Pulumi building blocks you need to be effective with Pulumi.

## Lab 1 - Create a Project

In this [lab](./lab-01/README.md), you'll initialize a new project in Pulumi

## Lab 2 - Create Your First Resource

In this [lab](./lab-02/README.md), you'll create your very first Pulumi resource, a Docker image. You'll learn how to define resource using Pulumi's TypeScript SDK
and learn how to install a new Pulumi provider.

## Lab 3 - Configuration & Outputs

In this [lab](./lab-03/README.md), you'll learn how to use Pulumi configuration in your project. You'll learn how to pass that configuration through to an application,
and make it required. 

In addition to this, you'll create a second resource which will introduce you to the concept of Pulumi "inputs & outputs"

## Lab 4 - Exported Outputs, Stack & Stack References

In this [lab](./lab-04/README.md),  you'll learn how to export infrastructure values from your stack and pass them to other stacks.
Finally, you'll learn about how configuration is related to Pulumi stacks and how your projects can be redeployed many times.
