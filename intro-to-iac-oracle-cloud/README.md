# Pulumi Workshop for Oracle Cloud

Follow along with us! This workshop repo is for the Oracle Cloud/Pulumi workshop in July 2022.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following tools:

* [Pulumi CLI](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/?utm_source=laura&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=workshops&utm_content=github-embedding-pulumi)
* [Pulumi FREE SaaS Account](https://app.pulumi.com/signup/?utm_source=laura&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=workshops&utm_content=github-embedding-pulumi)
  * Pulumi state storage is FREE for developers, you can use this account for all your personal Pulumi projects and you never need to worry about where to store your state 😃
* Python 3.9.x (Pulumi does not yet support Python 3.10)
* An Oracle Cloud account. The free tier plus the free credits should be all we need, but any costs accrued will be minimal if any appear at all.

## Part 1

Let's stand up a little bit of infrastructure!

## Part 2

What about new environments?

## Part 3
