# Part 1 - Creating some infrastructure

Start with a new directory called `oci-workshop`, and run `pulumi new python -y` in it.

Copy the contents of `__main__.py` into the new `__main__.py` file that appeared after you initialized the project.

Update your `requirements.txt` file to match the one here. Don't forget to run `pip install`!

Next, we'll set up all of our configurations, and talk about secrets.

Then, we'll run `pulumi up` to see how the system works.
