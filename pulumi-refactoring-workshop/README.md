# Pulumi Refactoring Workshop

This workshop will teach you how to refactor Pulumi projects without affecting the underlying infrastructure.

# Prerequisites

In order to complete the workshop, you'll need to have:
- The Pulumi CLI [installed](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/)
- The language interpreter for the [ programming language you're going to use with Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/languages/)
- A programming language IDE, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- Azure credentials

Due to wide matrix this creates across an intersection of languages and operating systems, we've also provided a prepared environment you can use using [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/)

*It's highly recommended to use the GitPod environment if at all possible*

## GitPod Instructions

1. Hit the button!

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/jaxxstorm/pulumi-refactoring-workshop/)

2. Wait for GitPod to initialize. You'll then need to login to Pulumi: provide your Pulumi access token from [here](https://app.pulumi.com/settings/tokens)

3. Fork the repo. You can do this within GitPod by hitting View -> Find Command -> type `fork`

## Pre-Workshop verification

In a working environment, you should be able to:

- run `docker info` and have docker return information about your installed Docker daemon
- run `pulumi version` and have Pulumi return a valid version
